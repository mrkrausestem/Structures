 ## App Exercise - Quiz Tracking
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a math tutoring app.
 
 Your app wouldn't be much of a tracker if it couldn't help users track their lessons. In order to track a user's lesson, you'll need to have some kind of data structure that can hold information about the lesson. For the sake of simplicity, you'll focus specifically on quizzes.
 
 Create a `Quiz` struct. It should have variables properties for `topic` (String), `date attempted` (String), `questionsAttempted`(Int), and `questionsCorrect`(Int). Make sure you provide an appropriate default value. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Create a variable instance of `Quiz` called `firstQuiz` then assign values to all of the properties using dot notation. Print out all properties of `firstQuiz`. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Write a function `calcGrade` that accepts two doubles as arguments and returns a double as a result. Pass the properties of firstQuiz into your function to calculate and display the results of the function in a print statement. (.5 points)
