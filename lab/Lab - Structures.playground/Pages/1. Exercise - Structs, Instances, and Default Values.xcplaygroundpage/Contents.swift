 ## Exercise - Structs, Instances, and Default Values
 
 You will need to create a data structure for your users. Create a structure called `Student` that contains the following properties: `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `gradeLevel` and `studentID`. Be sure to choose appropriate data types for these properties and default them to appropriate values. (.5 points)
 */

/*:
 Create a variable instance of `student` called `currentStudent`. It should be initialized without supplying any arguments. Print out the properties.
 */

/*:
 Change `currentStudent`'s properties to reflect your information then print the updated values.

/*:
 Now imagine you are making a social media app for sharing your favorite books. Create a `Book` struct with four variable properties: `title`, `author`, `pages`, and `price`. The default values for both `title` and `author` should be an empty string. `pages` should default to 0, and `price` should default to 0.0. (.5 points)
 */


/*:
 Create a variable instance of `Book` called `favoriteBook` without supplying any arguments. Print out the title of `favoriteBook`. Does it currently reflect the title of your favorite book? Probably not. Change all four properties of `favoriteBook` to reflect your favorite book. Then using the properties of `favoriteBook`, print out facts about the book.
